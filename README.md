# StockToDatabase
A C#-app that adds stock data from local files to a SQL database

This project is discontinued. It consisted of:
 1. a web scraper (Python) that I won't share. Output: csv-files with stock data for hundreds of Swedish stocks.
 2. a c# program that iterates over all the csv files and adds the records to a SQL database.
 3. a python script that prepares the data for machine learning
 4. a python script that applies some machine learning scripts to the data
